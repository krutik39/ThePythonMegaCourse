#File Handling

## Reading
.rstrip() in File handling to exclude and string in the list.
.seek(0) - to set the pointer to 0 while using readlines() instead of read()

 file=open("filename.txt",'r')
 """
 file is a variable
 where we assign a value of file by opening it in python using open().
 """
without closing the file changes won't be saved.
file.close()

##Writing
Writing a content inside a file
file.write("")
'w' method is not an append method.
It creates an empty file and write from the start.

r+ - Doesn't overwrite existing file but points the pointer at the top.
w+ - Overwrites the existing file
a+ - The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists.

Use "with" to avoid using file.close() for every time at the last of file handling statements.

using r at the beginning of doc string will ignore any functions and will consider it as a part of
doc string

ex: r"""
Hey There! How are you ? \n
"""
\n in the comment section won't go to next line. It will just display text as it is.
